				Some questions that I have answered because you might ask:
				<ul class="faqlist">
					<li>
						<b>Why did you use <i>that</i> logo?</b><br>
						The short reason is, because I can. The long reason is that this logo
						meshes much better with the NES' aesthetic, than the new logo. The new logo would look <i>downright weird</i>
						when downconverted to an NES-compatible screen.<br> Also, I just think it looks cool.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Which Chapters will the demo feature?</b><br>
						It is expected that the demo will feature Chapters 1 and 2 of Celeste
						in their entirety. If there is enough time, Chapter 3 may also be included in the demo.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Do you plan to publish this project as open-source?</b><br>
						Yes, I do! In fact, I'll do it as soon as the first demo is released.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Where did <i>that</i> logo come from?</b><br>
						Variations of this logo have been used for promotional material for Celeste during July-September of 2016.
