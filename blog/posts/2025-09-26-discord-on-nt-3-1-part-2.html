<h1>Discord on Windows NT 3.1, part 2</h1>

<p>See the original article from March 2025 <a href="2025-03-30-discord-on-nt-3-1.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>As you may know, Discord Messenger (my Discord client project) was ported to Windows NT 3.1 a while ago.
However, several developments have happened since then.</p>

<p>The compiler toolchain I use to compile Discord Messenger for archaic Windows versions is called Mingw-w64.
Previously I had been using a mix of MinGW 6.3.0 (for DiscordMessenger.exe), and Mingw-w64 for OpenSSL.</p>

<p>This changed a few weeks ago when I decided to try to modify the MinGW C runtime instead, to be compatible
with Windows NT 3.1, instead of circumnavigating its compatibility problems by wrapping Kernel32 with my
own DLL.</p>

<h3>Making my own compiler toolchain to target Windows NT 3.1</h3>

<p>Yes, I sat there and compiled GCC and friends (several times actually!) just to get this to work. But when
it finally did, it was a spectacular sight.</p>

<h4>First Steps</h4>

<p>To get started compiling the mingw-w64 toolchain from scratch, I firstly had to download all of the sources.
I <strong>do not</strong> recommend directly downloading from GNU servers unless you want to be sure about what you
are downloading, because they're ungodly slow. Instead, download a mirror, and simply compare the hashes/
signatures with the ones on the official GNU servers.  GCC's source code archive ended up being about 500 MB
in size (compressed), so prepare to wait a long time or use a faster mirror.</p>

<p>The versions I used:
- Binutils 2.4.0
- GCC 13.1.0
- Mingw-w64 v13.0.0</p>

<p>Now, I have made two diff files about what to modify in both GCC and Mingw-w64. This is not meant to be a
tutorial, though, just my recollection of the experience. For a tutorial on how to replicate my results, see:
<a href="https://github.com/DiscordMessenger/dm/blob/master/doc/pentium-toolchain/README.md">my Pentium toolchain build guide</a>
on the Discord Messenger repo.</p>

<h4>GCC</h4>

<p>In order to build GCC, I had to install the mingw-w64 headers, and then configure it so it compiles for the
Pentium architecture (instead of i686 like the package manager version).</p>

<h4>Mingw-w64 runtime</h4>

<p>The Mingw-w64 runtime was a bit more complicated. I had to change several things.</p>

<p>First, I had to edit Makefile.am and Makefile.in from mingw-w64-crt so that instead of passing a <code>_WIN32_WINNT</code>
version of <code>0xF00</code> (what?!) and a <code>__MSVCRT_VERSION__</code> of <code>0x600</code>, it uses a <code>_WIN32_WINNT</code> of <code>0x500</code>
(Windows 2000), and an <code>__MSVCRT_VERSION__</code> of <code>0x000</code> (corresponding to CRTDLL).</p>

<p><strong>Why did I need to target CRTDLL instead of MSVCRT?</strong> The reason why is because Windows NT 3.1 does <em>not</em>
come with MSVCRT, instead it comes with its more limited cousin, CRTDLL.dll. There are some missing APIs
that MSVCRT implements and CRTDLL doesn't, which I will go through later.</p>

<p>I had to edit <code>libsrc/dloadhelper.c</code> to remove the entire file if <code>_WIN32_WINNT &lt; 0x602</code> (Windows 8). Those
APIs did not exist in Windows 8 and I have no intention of using them.</p>

<p>I also had to implement calls such as <code>_wstat</code>, <code>_lseeki64</code> and <code>_telli64</code>, because they were not implemented
in CRTDLL. However, I ended up disabling Unicode dirent handling functions such as <code>_wfullpath</code>, because a
recreation of those would take longer than I've been willing to invest in this project. The consequence is
that I can't use those APIs in Discord Messenger, or other applications I compile with this toolchain, but I
think this is worth it.</p>

<p>Finally, I had to remove the static linking to <code>GetSystemTimeAsFileTime</code>, opting to instead use <code>GetProcAddress</code>
to get its address, and if it doesn't exist, then just call my emulation function.</p>

<p>These are all of the changes I had to make to the mingw-w64 runtime for it to build for Windows NT 3.1.</p>

<p>One more thing, you have to be <em>real patient</em> building the mingw-w64 CRT, as you have to do serial compilation
(<code>make</code> with 1 job), because there is allegedly a race condition which causes some files not to be found. So,
watch out for that. I was patient enough to wait the entire ~30 minutes or so for it to compile.</p>

<h4>Libgcc</h4>

<p>As it turns out I didn't disable gthreads (or more likely I couldn't), so I had to hack off some imports so that
the resulting program would run on NT 3.1:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>__gthread_equal</code> now checks the <em>handles</em> and not their <em>thread ID</em>, because <code>GetThreadId()</code> wasn't implemented
in NT 3.1.</p></li>
<li><p><code>__gthread_mutex_trylock</code> and <code>__gthread_recursive_mutex_trylock</code> had to be disabled (the try-lock fails every
time), because there is no <code>TryEnterCriticalSection</code> on NT 3.1 (and I wouldn't dare try to hack one to work,
because such actions are <em>bound</em> to be finnicky; Windows tends to change internal structures such as
<code>CRITICAL_SECTION</code>)</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>Libstdc++</h4>

<p>The C++ standard library had a few changes applied to it too, mostly related to the C++17 file system code.
On Windows, the C++17 filesystem implementation assumes Unicode characters for file paths and more, according
to <code>_GLIBCXX_FILESYSTEM_IS_WINDOWS</code>. I had to switch to ANSI versions of APIs (<code>GetFullPathNameA</code> instead of
<code>GetFullPathNameW</code> for example), and change all occurrences of <code>std::wstring</code> (and <code>std::wstring_view</code>) to their
UTF-8 counterparts.</p>

<p>I also had to disable use of <code>_rand_s</code>, because it doesn't exist in CRTDLL.</p>

<p>One more thing: <code>GetDiskFreeSpaceExA</code> does not exist on Windows 95, so don't use the <code>do_space</code> function.</p>

<h3>Missing _beginthreadex and _endthreadex`</h3>

<p>As it turns out, there are two MSVCRT dependencies in DiscordMessenger and OpenSSL that I had missed:
<code>_beginthreadex</code> and <code>_endthreadex</code>. It is not as simple as calling <code>CreateThread</code>, and that's because there is
CRTDLL specific initialization that happens before your main function.</p>

<p>Simulating <code>_beginthreadex</code> in terms of <code>_beginthread</code> (CRT's old thread creation function) is also not trivial,
because the parameters differ. Let's look at the function prototypes:</p>

<pre><code>uintptr_t _beginthread(
   void( __cdecl *start_address )( void * ),
   unsigned stack_size,
   void *arglist
);

uintptr_t _beginthreadex(
   void *security,
   unsigned stack_size,
   unsigned ( __stdcall *start_address )( void * ),
   void *arglist,
   unsigned initflag,
   unsigned *thrdaddr
);
</code></pre>

<p>Pretty different, huh? Not only that, the return value is different too!
- With <code>_beginthreadex</code>, you get a full <code>HANDLE</code> that you can close (to detach the thread), wait on, etc. Also,
the arguments completely match up with the <code>CreateThread</code> Win32 function including the start address' call
convention.</p>

<ul>
<li>Meanwhile, <code>_beginthread</code> is considerably simpler, it doesn't take in any security parameters, or an <code>initflag</code>,
or <code>thrdaddr</code>, which is where the thread's identifier is stored. The <code>start_address</code> also takes in a different
call convention (<code>__cdecl</code> instead of <code>__stdcall</code>), <em>and</em>, the <em>worst</em> part, while the return value is still a
<code>HANDLE</code>, it's different, in that the <code>HANDLE</code> actually goes away after the thread exits!</li>
</ul>

<p>I had to do the following, to emulate <code>_beginthreadex</code> in terms of <code>_beginthread</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Ignore the <code>security</code> and <code>initflag</code> parameters.  I do not use those.</p></li>
<li><p>Use a custom entry function declared <code>__cdecl</code> that waits on an auto-reset event, which is signalled right
before my implementation of <code>_beginthreadex</code> exits, to prevent the handle from being closed while the spawner
thread duplicates the handle (to match with <code>_beginthreadex</code> semantics).</p></li>
<li><p>Call <code>GetCurrentThreadId()</code> to also store the thread's ID in <code>thrdaddr</code> (if we weren't trying to target NT 3.1,
I'd rather call <code>GetThreadId(handle)</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>Check for any initialization errors during the thread's execution and abort safely if they occurred.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Discord Messenger runs! (Again!)</h3>

<p>And why wouldn't it. Look at this clean dump from Dependency Viewer! (it doesn't run on Windows NT 3.1, but I have
configured it to use the system paths for this version)</p>

<p><img src="images/dm-no-dependency-errors.png" alt="DiscordMessenger.exe with no errors in depends.exe" title="" /></p>

<h3>Standing on the shoulders of giants</h3>

<p>Well, that giant is... me from a few months ago! But of course, all of my <em>current</em> work relies on my past
research work, which was described in the <a href="previous article">2025-03-30-discord-on-nt-3-1.html</a>. Give that a
read if you are interested in the history of Discord Messenger ports for some reason.</p>

<h3>What about Win32s (again)?</h3>

<p>Win32s compatibility is closer than ever actually. Of course, I still need to get rid of <em>all</em> thread usage,
but this will be more feasible at some point in the future, because I have decided to try making Discord Messenger
use <code>libcurl</code> and <code>mbedtls</code> in <a href="https://github.com/DiscordMessenger/dm/pull/205">this PR</a>.</p>

<p>Since I can use these libraries in non-blocking mode, I could theoretically integrate those into the main thread
and actually get DM working on Win32s.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I will not be the one to try doing the Win32s port, but you're free to if you can glean anything
whatsoever from this article!</p>

<p>Additionally, some of the limitations still stand:
- 16MB RAM limit, so you will need to unload channels sooner or load fewer images (or none at all!)</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Global limit of about 65K handles</p></li>
<li><p>16-bit networking support is kind of bad</p></li>
<li><p>You're only going to be targeting 1 additional version of Windows, that being Windows 3.11 for Workgroups.
Windows 3.1 and earlier do not have network support at all.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The only way you could conceivably run Discord Messenger on Win32s is if you integrate libcurl+mbedtls into
the main thread (as opposed to running the networking and websockets in separate threads), and all the other
Win32s limitations.</p>

<h3>What's next?</h3>

<p>I have several plans for the future:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The aforementioned switch to libcurl and MbedTLS (which will require me to port those libraries to archaic
Windows), being performed in <a href="https://github.com/DiscordMessenger/dm/pull/205">this PR</a></p></li>
<li><p>Switching to a homebrew JSON parser, being done in <a href="https://github.com/DiscordMessenger/dm/pull/206">this PR</a>,
which is faster than <code>nlohmann::json</code></p></li>
<li><p>Allowing multiwindowing, being done in <a href="https://github.com/DiscordMessenger/dm/pull/209">this PR</a></p></li>
</ul>

<h3>I saw you mentioning Purplecord, what is it?</h3>

<p>Purplecord is meant to be an iOS 3 Discord client. It is currently minimally usable, but slow on the iPhone 3G,
and lacks support for basic features such as image attachments. It's in active development, though, and will be
released open source soon.</p>

<p>The first two of the mentioned PRs (<a href="https://github.com/DiscordMessenger/dm/pull/205">#205</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/DiscordMessenger/dm/pull/206">#206</a>) actually pull work directly from Purplecord, because
such work was downright necessary to create a good experience!</p>

<p>Here is a preview of Purplecord running on iOS 3 on my iPhone 3G:
<img src="images/purplecord-preview.png" alt="Purplecord running on my iPhone 3G, showing a message log from the Discord Messenger server" title="" /></p>

<p>I will discuss the challenges I ran into while writing Purplecord in a future article.</p>

<h3>In conclusion</h3>

<p>Why am I doing this? For the fun of it, of course, but also because I am actually passionate about old computers!
And I am especially satisfied when old computers do new things thought impossible because of the age gap.</p>

<p><strong>Do not take my "age gap" comment out of context.</strong></p>
