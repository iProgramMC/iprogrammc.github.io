<h1>Drawing Variable Width Fonts using CHR-ROM</h1>

<p>This is the first of a few articles detailing exactly what I have been doing to pull off certain tricks
in CelesteNES.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>After a few days of thinking how I'd do the dialogs in this game, I realized that there is text that
I might need to split up into several <em>dialog boxes</em>, which I found undesirable. So I started to look
for ways I could, maybe, render variable width fonts.</p>

<h2>Why not just use CHR-RAM?</h2>

<p>The main reason I decided against using CHR-RAM is because it would leave less space available for the
rest of the game. And I kind of need that space. Remember, Celeste (excluding Farewell) has about 500
rooms (and that's just the normal chapters! I do not plan on recreating the B- or C-sides.)</p>

<p>Most of PRG-ROM would be taken up by levels. Even if I managed to reach a 10% compression ratio on all
the graphics (which is unlikely given that Celeste's graphics are actually pretty detailed), I'd <em>still</em>
have a hard time fitting all that in.</p>

<h2>Why not just use 8x8 characters?</h2>

<p>I also decided against using a monospace 8x8 font because, well, the NES' tile resolution is <em>small</em>
(only 32 tiles in a line), and the portrait would take up like 5 characters, as well as the edges which
would be 2 characters each. Leaving me with only 25 characters per line. Some of Celeste's dialog uses
more than that, and on both lines! And some has really long text on all three lines. Here's an example
of the latter:
<img src="images/celeste-long-text.png" alt="Madeline talking on the payphone to someone" title="" /></p>

<p>See, 30, then 42, then 30 characters. I'd never be able to fit this using normal 8x8 fonts in a single
dialog! Sure, I could split it into two, but that's no fun.</p>

<h2>Celeste Mario's Zap &amp; Dash!</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/7915/">Celeste Mario's Zap &amp; Dash!</a> is a "ROM hack" of the original
Super Mario Bros. 1. (Ok, it's pretty much a rewrite at this point, let's admit it.)</p>

<p>One feature it includes is <em>dialog</em>. And you can guess what it does.</p>

<p><img src="images/cmznd-vwf.png" alt="CMZND screenshot. Variable width fonts are being shown." title="" /></p>

<p>That's right. It uses variable width fonts.</p>

<p>Now, how exactly does it do this. You may have a couple ideas in mind.</p>

<h3>CHR-RAM?</h3>

<p>You might think it's CHR-RAM. Let's look at the beginning of the file in a hex editor:
<code>
000000: 4E 45 53 1A 10 10 52 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 80 | NES...R..........
</code></p>

<p>This is CMZND's iNES header. See <a href="https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/NES_2.0">the NESdev Wiki article</a> about
it. You can immediately see that offset 5 (CHR-ROM size) is not zero. Therefore, this game has CHR ROM
installed. You will also want to look at offset 11 (the CHR RAM size), and you'll see that it is zero.
Therefore there is no CHR-RAM installed.</p>

<h3>Sprites?!</h3>

<p>Nope! The NES, notoriously, has an 8 sprite per scanline limit. So, obviously, you can't draw a whole
dialog. (I'm actually constantly fighting this very limitation myself, but in other parts of the game!)</p>

<p>If none of these, then what?</p>

<h3>The Raster Tricks</h3>

<p>Here is a screenshot of the Event Viewer in <a href="https://mesen.ca">Mesen</a>, with CMZND opened and a dialog
being shown in-game.</p>

<p><img src="images/cmznd-event-viewer.png" alt="Mesen Event Viewer" title="" /></p>

<p>Notice all these blue writes next to the one I highlighted? Those update the <code>PPUADDR</code> register (<code>$2006</code>).
Some of the writes above seem to have to do with the mapper, but I didn't look too deep into the MMC5
mapper that it uses so I wouldn't know.</p>

<p>The writes that you can see after the frame ended are only to update the HUD, from what I can tell.</p>

<p>It constantly writes <code>$00</code> to <code>$5104</code> (Internal ExRAM mode) and <code>$AA</code> to <code>$5105</code> (Nametable Mapping).
(See <a href="https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/MMC5">the NESdev Wiki article about MMC5</a>.)  I don't know why it isn't
just configuring it once and screwing off, but I digress.</p>

<p>The point is, the <code>PPUADDR</code> is updated every line during horizontal blank. (While rendering that actually
does all sorts of things, but one of those is the coarse Y which this adjusts.)</p>

<p>Here is another screenshot of the tile map at the moment when those scanlines are rendered.</p>

<p><img src="images/cmznd-tilemap.png" alt="Mesen Tile Map Viewer" title="" /></p>

<p>This is a binary counting pattern stretched along the Y axis.</p>

<p>And if you couldn't guess, here's what the CHR bus for background rendering looks like during the dialog:</p>

<p><img src="images/cmznd-tile-counting-pattern.png" alt="Mesen Tile Viewer showing a counting pattern" title="" /></p>

<p>So, basically, it uses these tiles to render text that would otherwise be impossible on the NES without
CHR-RAM. Neat!</p>

<h2>Caveats</h2>

<p>In <em>Celeste Mario's Zap &amp; Dash!</em>, the dialog is drawn to separate ExRAM, and switched to at the moment
when the dialog is supposed to be drawn. My game does not have that. It has nowhere near the advancement
level of MMC5, actually.</p>

<p>Still, this was too cool to pass up, so I ended up borrowing the method for my own use.</p>

<h2>How does it look in-game?</h2>

<p><img src="images/celestenes-dialog.png" alt="Madeline talking to Granny, in CelesteNES" title="" /></p>

<p>Like this! Ain't it nice?!</p>

<p>Here's a screenshot of the event viewer:</p>

<p><img src="images/celestenes-event-viewer.png" alt="Mesen Event Viewer showing CelesteNES dialog rendering process" title="" /></p>

<p>It actually looks pretty different, however, the idea is still the same, so it counts. But what am
I doing?</p>

<p>Let's start with the differences:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I use the split X/Y scroll method instead of overwriting PPUADDR. Because I can. And because of
a game design quirk where sometimes, the level may be split vertically across two nametables (ok,
really, it's just one nametable, but half of the level is on the top, and the other on the bottom).
I want to override the Y scroll to the origin of the dialog, as well.</p></li>
<li><p>I don't have ExRAM, so I simply push the dialog to unused nametable space. This makes the dialog
routines considerably more complex since I will have to handle nametable wraparound.</p>

<p>Case in point:
<img src="images/celestenes-tilemap-viewer.png" alt="Mesen Tile Map Viewer showing stretched dialog text" title="" /></p></li>
<li><p>The attribute table has been cleared to fully-white, so the text isn't colored. I <em>could</em> do that,
but it'd be limited to rows, as I risk accidentally coloring other characters as well.</p></li>
<li><p>I don't know if CMZND does this too, but I reschedule the IRQ a few lines after the dialog line
finished rendering to fend off potential misalignments caused by DPCM read cycles. This is a real
and visible problem now that ButterSoap, our music composer, has added DPCM samples to his cover
of <em>First Steps</em>.  Yes, my tightly timed loops will be misaligned, but not so badly as to cause
visible glitches.</p></li>
<li><p>Obviously, I draw the text at the <em>top</em>, instead of the bottom, though I might add that feature
in later. Chapter 3 of Celeste in particular uses dialog boxes on the bottom, because placing
them above would obscure important parts of the story.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The main principle is the same as in <em>Celeste Mario's Zap &amp; Dash!</em>, though.</p>

<h2>Drawing</h2>

<p>Ok, but how much space does this take up?</p>

<p>Well, of course, one whole nametable. That much is clear. It also uses an extra 768 bytes of RAM,
to store a 256X24 1bpp bitmap. Writes to this bitmap (e.g. when a letter appears) are mirrored
to the specific nametable where the byte resides. (Yes, I really do write 8 bytes per 8x8 block of
pixels updated)</p>

<h2>A potential nicety?</h2>

<p>Most of the space in my counting pattern is actually unused. That's because, for each line, I just
scroll to the <em>top</em> of the tile. Therefore, the rest is never visible. I actually use this for the
<code>$FF</code> tile - I can reuse it as a border, after clearing out most of the tile, leaving only the top
filled in with pixels.</p>

<p>However, because I can't control the top row of tiles, I'm not sure how useful this would actually
be.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This nice raster trick allows me to use variable width/proportional fonts while using CHR ROM,
allowing me to keep my (relatively) fast loading times and use as much PRG-ROM space for levels.</p>

<p>There are <em>so many</em> limitations with the NES, but I'm trying to fight off each one of them to
produce the best experience that I can.</p>
