# How does CelesteNES manage palettes (DPLS)

In this article I want to explain what I do to manage palettes within CelesteNES.
Note that only *sprite* palettes are managed by DPLS, not *background* palettes.
Those might be managed separately with a manual setting or something.

## The problem

The situation was once quite simple.  There were four palettes loaded in at once:

- the player palette (beige, purple, and cyan)
- red
- green
- blue

Obviously some sprites do *not* fit into these palettes. Examples include elevators (gray),
keys (gold), and Granny (white, beige, and green).  Not to mention, dialogs come with their
own problems which this also aims to solve.

## Introducing DPLS

DPLS, a/k/a Dipples, a/k/a *Dynamic Palette Loading System*, is the palette manager within
CelesteNES. As the name suggests, it manages sprite palettes dynamically. Here's how it works:

- The player's hair, and then each entity, requests a palette, through `gm_allocate_palette`.
It may, or may not, be allocated. Remember, you can only have four sprite palettes on the NES,
and the player's body occupies one slot, being hardcoded in unlike the rest.

- After the game loop ends, a backup copy of last frame's palettes is compared with the current
list of palettes. If anything changes, the relevant NMI flag is set, and the NMI will upload
the palette to the PPU properly.

- Finally, when the game loop begins, the current palette is copied to the backup, then the
relevant palette allocation variables are cleared.

## Conclusion

I know this article is shorter than the last one. There wasn't too much to explain, really.
DPLS is a simple, yet versatile, system, that allows me to put entities with 2 types of palettes
with no problems.

It also allows me to make Madeline's hair pink in The Summit which I might do at some point
after the first demo comes out. Hopefully.
