TITLE:Hello!
# Hello!

Hi there. This is the first article on my website.

Note, I will not be able to do any interactive stuff because I use GitHub
Pages to host my site. So if you have any comments about one of my posts,
please tell me through a communication platform such as [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/iprogramincpp.com),
Discord (@iprogramincc), or e-mail (this website's name (minus the .com)
@gmail.com)

## What am I working on right this moment?

I am working on this article, of course. But the ongoing project I'm working on
right now is [CelesteNES](https://iprogramincpp.com/celestenes/index.html).
Go there to see more about it.

I will post more about it soon, there's plenty of interesting stuff I would like
to document here.

## How did you *do* this?

[iProgramInCpp's MarkdownBlogThing!](https://github.com/iProgramMC/MarkdownBlogThing)
It's just a hacky shell script. In fact, the entire thing can actually be found
right in the GitHub Pages repo.

## Just testing some more markdown stuff

First, a list of

- Things
- Stuff
- And more...

Then, an image:
