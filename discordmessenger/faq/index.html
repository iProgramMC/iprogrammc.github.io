						<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
						
						<div class="blurb">
							<h3>Will Voice Chats be supported?</h3>
							
							Probably not.  Feel free to <a href="https://github.com/DiscordMessenger/dm/pulls">submit a PR</a> if you want to change that.
						</div>
						<div class="blurb">
							<h3>How do I enable dark mode?</h3>
							
							<p>
								Discord Messenger <i>adapts to your system theme</i>. On Windows 7 and earlier, just apply a dark theme.
								On 10 and 11, it happens to always match the Aero Basic theme. So change the current theme to something dark. You can use third-party theme modifiers for that.
								You can also use <b>High Contrast</b> mode.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								If you want, you can set a <b>message background image</b>, and if you set a dark one, the message text will invert colors to stay visible. If you don't want to
								use High Contrast mode or third party theme changers, then on Windows 10 and 11 this is the closest you can get currently.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								Explorer-style Dark Mode will probably not be supported anytime soon, as it is an unofficial solution that relies on undocumented APIs.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="blurb">
							<h3>What version of Discord Messenger should I run?</h3>
							
							There are three builds of Discord Messenger available:
							
							<ul>
								<li>
									<b>MSVC Version</b>: This version of DM is recommended for Windows 7 and newer. It will work on Windows XP SP2, SP3, and
									Vista as well, though. You may need to install the <b>Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable (x86)</b> package, of
									which a download is provided on the <a href="../download">download</a> page.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>MinGW Unicode Version</b>: This version of DM is recommended for Windows NT 4.0 and later NT builds.  This version will <b>not</b>
									run on Windows 9x because it does not implement the Unicode standard, and it isn't recommended for NT 3.x either.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>MinGW ANSI Version</b>: This version of DM is recommended <b>only</b> on Windows 9x and Windows NT 3.x. Please do not use this
									version on Windows 2000 or later. If you decide to use this version anyway, do not wonder about the missing international character
									support.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div class="blurb">
							<h3>I get a "0xC000001D" / Illegal operation error from LIBCRYPT.DLL or libcrypto-3.dll when running Discord Messenger!</h3>
							
							<p>
								You are getting this error because <b>your CPU is too old</b>. Discord Messenger currently requires a <b>Pentium Pro</b>
								or <b>Pentium 2</b> CPU to run.
							</p>
							<p>
								This will be fixed in the next build.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="blurb">
							<h3>The MSVCP140.dll file is missing!</h3>
							
							You are getting this error because you did not install the Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable (x86).  Make sure
							to have the x86 version installed, the x64 version will not make Discord Messenger work.
						</div>
						<div class="blurb">
							<h3>I get some error about the NtCreateFile API missing, and this error shouldn't appear because it's specific to the Lan Manager</h3>
							
							<p>
								This is a localization bug. In actuality it's most likely trying to tell you that MSVCP140.dll is missing, see the above question for a fix
							</p>
							<p>
								This string appears because STATUS_OPEN_FAILED (0xC0000136) is exactly next to STATUS_DLL_NOT_FOUND (0xC0000135) which is the actual error
								reported, and the localizers made a mistake and accidentally swapped or shifted the actual error strings.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="blurb">
							<h3>Where's your "Purplecord" thing? Also what is it</h3>
							
							<p>It's coming soon!</p>
							
							<p>It is an attempt to write a Discord client for iOS 3 based on the research performed for Discord Messenger. Currently it is not even in a functionable state.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="blurb">
							<h3>You are not logged in to Discord Messenger</h3>
							
							<p>Chances are high you pasted in the wrong token, included some additional quotation marks or spaces by accident, or mistyped it.</p>
							
							<p>
								<b>V1.09 WARNING</b>: Some links (notably olx.ua / olx.pl) when pasted cause Discord Messenger to log you out even if the token is correct.
								You can paste in the same token you've been using and it will work.  To remove this annoyance, if you are using the MinGW (ANSI) build of DM
								you can <a href="https://nightly.link/DiscordMessenger/dm/workflows/build/master">upgrade to the latest nightly</a>.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="blurb">
							<h3>What even is the difference between versions anyway?</h3>
							
							<p>
								The main difference is the compiler toolchain used to compile DM.  The MSVC version was compiled with <b>Visual Studio 2022</b>, while the MinGW version
								was compiled with the <b>MinGW</b> (Minimalist GNU for Windows) toolchain.
							</p>
							<p>
								The MinGW version has two sub-versions: Unicode and ANSI.  The Unicode version comes with support for international characters (in the limit of your
								installed fonts), while the ANSI version only makes an attempt to convert UTF-8 to your current codepage and international characters are not shown.
							</p>
							<p>
								The MSVC version does not require two separate versions because Unicode is supported on all versions of Windows that the MSVC version runs on.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="blurb">
							<h3>I have a bug, fix it NOW or I... // My Discord account was compromised/banned because of your client and now I will...</h3>
							
							<p>
								Stop right there.  I am developing this project in my <b>free time</b>, therefore I have no obligation to fix any of the bugs
								that this client has.  I will most likely fix those bugs at some point, but <b>only when I have time for this project</b>.
								Keep in mind that I am juggling several other projects, as well as education and a job, so I don't always have time for this
								project!
							</p>
							<p>
								You use this client <b>at your own risk</b>, therefore, do not blame me (iProgramInCpp) for any issues that appear with your account.
								You have <b>full ownership</b> of your account, so make the correct decision!
